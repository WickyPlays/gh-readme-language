# Github Readme Language
## What is this?
Welcome to Github Readme Language (aka GH-Readme-Language).

This small project allows you to dynamically grab all languages that you have contributed on your or others' Github on README!

> [!IMPORTANT]
I am a solo developer for this project, therefore not every features could be covered just yet given the time that I have for other stuffs. However, you can contribute to the project! Read Contribution section for info.

## How to use
Simple. Simply add the following into your README.md and you're good to go!

```
![My stats](https://gh-readme-language.vercel.app/api/WickyPlays)

This would be the result:
