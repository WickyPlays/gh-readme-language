# Github Readme Language

## What is this?

Welcome to Github Readme Language (aka GH-Readme-Language).

This small project allows you to dynamically grab all languages that you have contributed on your or others' Github on README!

Originally this was only meant for my own portfolio README or website, but you guys can now experience it too!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I am a solo developer for this project, therefore not every features could be covered just yet given the time that I have for other stuffs. However, you can contribute to the project! Read Contribution section for info.

## How to use

Simple. Simply add the following into your README.md (replace username with your Github username) and you're good to go!

```
![My stats](https://gh-readme-language.vercel.app/api/username)
```

This would be the result:
